# Revagenda
Revagenda is another project that will run parallel to P0, 1, and 2. This is a collaborative project that will be very similar in function to the solo projects. We will be building this together to practice collaboration and agile concepts. A scaffold will be given to associates, and development will be driven by a kanban board. Associates will be encouraged to take and complete work items as we go. The trainer will also participate as we progress to offer example code.

## Phase 0
Phase 0 will go hand-in-hand with Project 0, and will involve the same technologies. The scaffold will already have some infrastructure and associates will be expected to take one or more work items, model workflows, design views, and persist data.

## Phase 1
Phase 1 will go hand-in-hand with Project 1. The scaffold will be expanded to a 3-tier server stack. Associates will be expected to take one or more work items involving building API endpoints.

## Phase 2
Phase 2 will go hand-in-hand with Project 2. The scaffold will be replaced with a Spring Boot project. Associates will be expected to take one or more work items involved with completing a full workflow from receiving an API request, through the different layers, to persist or retrieve data, and finally respond to the initial request.

# Project 0 - Console Banking App
You will start this project with no code, and end with a working console application that simulates a simple banking app. Users should be presented with a menu explaining their current options, and they should be able to type input to control the application and initiate workflows which create, read, update, and delete information in the database. This interaction will repeat as the user works with the application:
 - User is shown a menu and prompted to enter text input
 - Input is accepted, parsed, and validated
 - User advances through the workflow, the previous two steps are repeated
 - Eventually the workflow is completed and either the user is brought back to a previous menu, or the application terminates.

The purpose of this project is to practice core programming concepts and workflows. During this project we will be focusing on core Java concepts, OOP, unit testing, and agile workflows.

This application should be written primarily in Java. We will persist data in an Oracle SQL database, and some SQL code will be used to preform CRUD operations via JDBC.

Important technologies:
 - Java 
 - SQL 
 - JDBC 
 - Junit
 - Mockito
 - Log4J

Concepts to master:
 - Flow Control
 - Testing
 - Data Persistence
 - Interoperability
 - OOP

## Functional Requirements
 - This application must persist information about users and their bank accounts in an Oracle database
 - This application should provide a series of console menus allowing users to complete workflows
 - This application must perform CRUD operations via JDBC on the Oracle database
 - This application must be resilient to SQL injection
 - This application must log all transactions
 - This application must authenticate users before performing any operations on user accounts
 - This application must validate user input for correctness (for example: no depositing negative dollar amounts)

## User Stories - MVP
 - Guest - As a new user I should be able to create a user account with username and password
 - Guest - As an unauthenticated guest I should be able to log into my user account with username and password
 - User - As a user I should be able to create a bank account
 - User - As a user I should be able to deposit funds into my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to withdraw funds from my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to change my account password
 - User - As a user I should be able to delete a bank account with a balance of $0.00
 
## User Stories - Stretch Goals
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to do everything a user can do
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to change the role of other user accounts
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to delete a user
 - User - As a user I should be able to share my bank account(s) with other users
 - User - As a user I should be able to transfer funds between my bank accounts
 - User - As a user I should be able to view a history of my transactions

## Suggested Timeline:

Week 1 - Modeling, researching, pseudocode. By the end of week 1 you should be ready to begin making progress implementing the MVP features. We will be covering unit testing early, so I suggest considering Test-Driven Development.

Week 2 -  We continue discussing Java in week 2, and as we go along you should have the tools necessary to complete most of the project. By the end of week 2 you should have a console application that can prompt the user and accept input. You should be well on the way to implementing the MVP features, except for persistence.

Week 3 - We introduce SQL and JDBC in week 3, and once we have covered these topics you should have everything needed to complete the workflows by persisting the data. By the end of the week you should be ready for a code freeze. If you still have time, now would be a good time to consider optional stretch goals.

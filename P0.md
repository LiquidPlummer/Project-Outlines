# Project 0
In this first project the associates will begin with nothing and end with a Java console-based banking app. They will need to maintain persistent data for at least two entity types, users, and accounts. This project will be running from week 1 until the showcase in week 4. We will have a code freeze on the Thursday of week 3, and the remaining two days will be for polish and bug fixes. 

In week 1 we cover core Java topics, and introduce the concept of unit testing.
In week 2 we continue to cover core JAva, and introduce the concept of logging.
In week 3 we introduce data persistence with SQL, interoperability with JDBC, and the concept of mocking.

By the end of week 3 we will have covered all topics necessary to complete the requirements of the project. The project is due shortly thereafter, associates will be given time to work on these projects, with extra time devoted toward the end of the week. Every piece of the puzzle necessary to build P0 will be provided in demo form during these three weeks.

Important technologies:
 - Java 
 - SQL 
 - JDBC 
 - Junit
 - Mockito
 - Log4J

Concepts to master:
 - Flow Control
 - Testing
 - Data Persistence
 - Interoperability
 - OOP

## Requirements
 - This application must persist information about users and their bank accounts in an Oracle database.
 - This application should provide a series of console menus allowing users to complete workflows.
 - This application must perform CRUD operations via JDBC on the Oracle database
 - This application must log all transactions
 - this application must authenticate users before performing any operations on user accounts

## User Stories - MVP
 - Guest - As a new user I should be able to create a user account with username and password
 - Guest - As an unauthenticated guest I should be able to log into my user account with username and password
 - User - As a user I should be able to create a bank account
 - User - As a user I should be able to deposit funds into my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to withdraw funds from my bank account(s)
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to 

 
## User Stories - Stretch Goals
 - User - As a user I should be able to 
 - User - As a user I should be able to transfer funds between my bank accounts
 - User - As a user I should be able to share my bank account(s) with another user

# Project 2
You will start this project with your completed P1, and refactor it as a Spring API. We will continue refining our application according to modern architecture and best practices. Just like before we will eschew the client, and demonstrate our API by sending requests from Postman. You can “Springify” your existing application, but it might be better to start with a new Spring Boot application and migrate your old code into the new project.

Javalin will be replaced by Spring Web. JDBC will be abstracted away with Hibernate and Spring Data. Major classes in each layer should be replaced with Spring Beans. Consider Spring AOP for cross-cutting concerns like logging.

All of the same workflows from P0 and P1 will need to be refactored, and there are several new functional requirements to keep in mind for P2.

#### In addition to the MVP features, you must select at minimum 4 stretch goals to include in your final deliverable. Change the cards for those features to be labeled as “MVP” instead of “Stretch Goal”. This is 2 new user stories in addition to the 2 selected as part of P1.

The purpose of this project is to continue honing core programming skills, while practicing modern technologies, architecture, and best practices. A greater emphasis will be placed on code quality: A very polished and refined deliverable is expected.

 ## Functional Requirements
 - This application must persist information about users and their bank accounts in an Oracle database
 - This application should provide a series of API endpoints allowing users to complete workflows
 - This application must perform CRUD operations via JDBC on the Oracle database
 - This application must be resilient to SQL injection
 - This application must log all transactions
 - This application must authenticate users before performing any operations on user accounts
 - This application must provide a token in response to authentication
 - This application must accept and parse the authentication token to authorize all other workflows
 - This application must validate user input for correctness (for example: no depositing negative dollar amounts)
 - This application should not store plaintext passwords in the database
 - Dollar amounts in this application should not be subject to floating point precision errors


Important new technologies:
 - Spring - Web, Data, Boot, AOP

Concepts to master:
 - Continuous Integration

## User Stories - MVP
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request. The console should be deprecated. 
 - Guest - As a new user I should be able to create a user account with username and password
 - Guest - As an unauthenticated guest I should be able to log into my user account with username and password
 - User - As a user I should be able to create a bank account
 - User - As a user I should be able to deposit funds into my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to withdraw funds from my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to change my account password
 - User - As a user I should be able to delete a bank account with a balance of $0.00
 
## User Stories - Stretch Goals
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request.
 - User - As a user I should be able to share my bank account(s) with other users
 - User - As a user I should be able to transfer funds between my bank accounts
 - User - As a user I should be able to view a history of my transactions
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to change the role of other user accounts
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to delete a user
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to do everything a user can do

## Suggested Timeline:
Week 6 - We have already been introduced to Spring in week 5, and should be ready to transform P1 into P2. This transformation won't necessarily change the overall architecture of the server. By the end of the week you should be well on your way to completing P2.

Week 7 - We introduce no new concepts in week 7. There is ample time for practice, review, and project work here. Consider a code freeze on Tuesday.

# Project 2
In this project the associates will begin with their completed P1, and refactor it into a Spring application. They will need to refactor the API layer to utilize Spring Web, the data layer to utilize Spring Data, and the service layer to be side-effect free. The focus for this project will be to make sure the application from P1 adheres to best practices and a well defined 3-tier architecture. The remaining functional requirements remain the same. This project will run from week 6 to the showcase at the end of week 7.

By the time we begin this project we will have already covered all the necessary topics to complete it. This project is an opportunity to put everything we have covered thus far into a well polished product to be proudly showcased. We will not necessarily provide a perfect demo of every piece of the project. Extra focus will be placed on the process of producing quality software. Continuous integration, code analysis, and agile workflows will be

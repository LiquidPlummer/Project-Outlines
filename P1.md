# Project 1
In this project the associates will begin with their completed P0, and end with a Java banking API. They will need to expose endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the database. The application will begin to take shape as a 3-tier server stack with presentation, service, and data layers. Associates will test and demonstrate their application by accessing the API via Postman. This project will run from week 4 to the showcase on Monday of week 6. 

In week 4 we cover HTTP, REST, and Javalin.
In week 5 we begin on advanced Java programming and introduce Spring.

By the end of week 4 we will have covered the topics necessary to complete the project. This gives lots of time to iterate on P0 to add an API and refactor it into a more explicitly defined server stack. Every piece of the puzzle necessary to build P1 will be provided in demo form during this time.

Important new technologies:
 - HTTP
 - Javalin

New concepts to master:
 - Code analysis
 - Server Architecture
 - REST

## Requirements
 - This application must persist information about users and their bank accounts in an Oracle database
 - This application should provide a series of API endpoints allowing users to complete workflows
 - This application must perform CRUD operations via JDBC on the Oracle database
 - This application must be resilient to SQL injection
 - This application must log all transactions
 - This application must authenticate users before performing any operations on user accounts
 - This application must provide a token in response to authentication
 - This application must accept and parse the authentication token to authorize all other workflows
 - This application must validate user input for correctness (for example: no depositing negative dollar amounts)
 - This application should not store plaintext passwords in the database
 - Dollar amounts in this application should not be subject to floating point precision errors

## User Stories - MVP
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request. The console should be deprecated. 
 - Guest - As a new user I should be able to create a user account with username and password
 - Guest - As an unauthenticated guest I should be able to log into my user account with username and password
 - User - As a user I should be able to create a bank account
 - User - As a user I should be able to deposit funds into my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to withdraw funds from my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to change my account password
 - User - As a user I should be able to delete a bank account with a balance of $0.00
 
## User Stories - Stretch Goals
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request. The console should be deprecated. 
 - User - As a user I should be able to share my bank account(s) with other users
 - User - As a user I should be able to transfer funds between my bank accounts
 - User - As a user I should be able to view a history of my transactions
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to change the role of other user accounts
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to delete a user
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to do everything a user can do

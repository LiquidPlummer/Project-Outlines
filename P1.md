# Project 1
You will start this project with your completed P0, and refactor it to add new functionality. We will be separating the concerns here into client and server, and we will be eschewing the client application. A completed P1 simulates the server side of a client-server application. Normally the client portion of the application would handle all user interaction and send HTTP requests to the API to initiate workflows. We won't have a client, instead we will just send the HTTP requests directly from Postman, simulating a real client.

These simulated workflows would look like this:

 - User interacts with the client, being prompted for information and inputting that information. Once complete the client would wrap that info up into a JSON payload and transmit it to the API to initiate a workflow. We will simply generate this HTTP request and payload and begin there.
 - HTTP request received by server. Information is extracted, and transformed into objects. Service-layer method is invoked to continue process.
 - Service layer performs duties and invokes persistence-layer methods to create, read, update, or delete information.
 - Persistence-layer methods preform necessary CRUD operations on database via JDBC.
 - Return up the stack to the presentation-layer.
 - Prepare response to initial request. Transform data objects into JSON payload and transmit back to client.

All of the same workflows from P0 will need to be refactored, and there are several new functional requirements to keep in mind for P1.

#### In addition to the MVP features, you must select at minimum 2 stretch goals to include in your final deliverable. Change the cards for those features to be labeled as “MVP” instead of “Stretch Goal”.

The purpose of this project is to continue honing core programming skills, while practicing modern technologies, architecture, and best practices.

This application should be written primarily in Java. We will persist data in an Oracle SQL database, and some SQL code will be used to preform CRUD operations via JDBC. We will use Javalin for building the API, and separate the server into three distinct layers.

## Functional Requirements
 - This application must persist information about users and their bank accounts in an Oracle database
 - This application should provide a series of API endpoints allowing users to complete workflows
 - This application must perform CRUD operations via JDBC on the Oracle database
 - This application must be resilient to SQL injection
 - This application must log all transactions
 - This application must authenticate users before performing any operations on user accounts
 - This application must provide a token in response to authentication
 - This application must accept and parse the authentication token to authorize all other workflows
 - This application must validate user input for correctness (for example: no depositing negative dollar amounts)
 - This application should not store plaintext passwords in the database
 - Dollar amounts in this application should not be subject to floating point precision errors


Important new technologies:
 - HTTP
 - Javalin

New concepts to master:
 - Code analysis
 - Server Architecture
 - REST

## User Stories - MVP
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request. The console should be deprecated. 
 - Guest - As a new user I should be able to create a user account with username and password
 - Guest - As an unauthenticated guest I should be able to log into my user account with username and password
 - User - As a user I should be able to create a bank account
 - User - As a user I should be able to deposit funds into my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to withdraw funds from my bank account(s)
 - User - As a user I should be able to change my account password
 - User - As a user I should be able to delete a bank account with a balance of $0.00
 
## User Stories - Stretch Goals
The following workflows are unchanged from P0, but should now be initiated by sending an API request. The console should be deprecated. 
 - User - As a user I should be able to share my bank account(s) with other users
 - User - As a user I should be able to transfer funds between my bank accounts
 - User - As a user I should be able to view a history of my transactions
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to change the role of other user accounts
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to delete a user
 - Admin - As an admin I should be able to do everything a user can do

## Suggested Timeline:

Week 4 - Research and refactor design. Begin by thinking about how processes will need to change to accommodate the new architecture. Begin separating concerns and classes into 3 layers. As the week progresses we will be introduced to Javalin, and we can begin refactoring the code.

Week 5 - We discuss topics not necessary for P1. You should already have everything necessary to complete this project. By the end of this week you should be finished and ready for a code freeze.

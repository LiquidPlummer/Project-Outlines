# Project 1
In this project the associates will begin with their completed P0, and end with a Java banking API. They will need to expose endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the database. The application will begin to take shape as a 3-tier server stack with presentation, service, and data layers. Associates will test and demonstrate their application by accessing the API via Postman. This project will run from week 4 to the showcase on Monday of week 6. 

In week 4 we cover HTTP, REST, and Javalin.
In week 5 we begin on advanced Java programming and introduce Spring.

By the end of week 4 we will have covered the topics necessary to complete the project. This gives lots of time to iterate on P0 to add an API and refactor it into a more explicitly defined server stack. Every piece of the puzzle necessary to build P1 will be provided in demo form during this time.

Important new technologies:
 - HTTP
 - Javalin

New concepts to master:
 - Code analysis
 - Server Architecture
 - REST
